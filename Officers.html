			<p>
				Hello, my name is Samantha Sun, and I am currently a senior in bioengineering. I am honored to serve as your president of the University of Washington's Tau Beta Pi chapter, and I am looking forward to working with members and the community to inspire curiosity in engineering and promote academic and professional excellence. This year, the officers and I are working hard to improve our chapter and increase our presence in the community, so please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or would like to contribute to our chapter.<br>
